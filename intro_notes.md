## Presentation of Research groups

The following are research groups that may act as supervisors and guide our project direction.

### Algorithms group - algorithms.itu.dk

Main tool is math and theory

Themes:
1. Algorithmic engineering

Implement a known algorithm and design a good test case suite to test its correctness and performance - does it align with theory?

2. Theory of algorithms

Study computational problem and create a new algorithm to solve it

3. Visualization of algorithms

Program an animation of a known algorithm and explain how it works

### Audio-visual computing

- Spatial audio, generative AI, art and XR.

- Bring events (opera for example) to a remote location to bring a physical reality and the virtual.

- 3D reconstruction of art pieces, faces, body motion
- Expression transfer
- Body motion analysis

### Brain lab - brainlabe.itu.dk

- Research about machine learning to figure out how the brain works
- Physical space to record motion capture, heart rate, neuroscience, phsyiology markers, EEG, eye tracking
- Experiments that mimic real life, use data to figure out why people make choices
- What happens in the game when somebody jumps in the game
Purpose: create better tools to figure out how the brain works, how are images translated from the retina

Potential projects

- uncanny valley effect

### CISAT carsten@itu.dk Carsten Schumann

- Security
- Cyberwar
- Election security and disinformation
- Formal verification
- IOT security, eyes trackers
- Social engineering
- Saellite security

How are our satelllite secure?

### DIIP

Danish instinute for it program management

- Studying IT projects as it relates to impact on the academy, plicy, practice and public debate
- Should we digitize everything?
- How do citizens interact with the public sector

### DASYA - dasya.itu.dk

Data intensive systems and applications

- hardware, operating systems, frameworks and applications

- medical image analysis

- using modern hardware better

### NLP North

Natural language processing

- Toxic language classification


### NERDS research group - nerds.itu.dk

Networks data and socieity, using DS, ML, AI to study 

- Understanding social systems

Polarization on social media

How museums borrow art

What did people dream about during covid

Geospatial bike networks.

Recommendation systems

### PLS, the programming logic and semanticcs research groups

- Software bugs costs lives and millions of $
- Example project, verify project is correct
- Property based testing of financial contracts

### real.itu.dk

robots and ai

### Software engineering researchers

Human aspect of building software

Mircealungu.com

devtools, supporting learners on their journey

### Software quality research group, square.itu.dk

Pragmatics of building high quality software by using technology

Test methods, modelling, architecture, language technology

What is good software; What are the metrics?

## How to find a research project and supervisor

- Question to ask ourself: what do we want to write our thesis about? Does not need to be exact, but limit scope to within your specialization/electives. What topics are we interested in?

## What is a good thesis topic

- It has to be interesting to **you**
- It must be **interesting to your supervisor**
- It must use tools, languages, techniques and theories **that you find interesting**
- It must **advance what we know** and be somewhat novel
- It has to be a **topic within computer science**

## Finding a supervisor

- Supervisor must be a researcher in the computer science department

## How to contact a supervisor

- Write a short brief email (3-4 lines)
- Ask for an appointment

## Problem statement

- Must be a one-page problem state, what is it exactly we are trying to do?
- What problem are we trying to solve
- Why anyone would be interested in that
- How you imagine to go about it

The prroblem statement must be high quality, considered and well though out.
