## Scalable distributed financial transaction system

Could be a proof of concept using [Tigerbeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com). See [demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1B3d9C_sI)

## Implementing some kind of algo as fast as possible

- Pick a baseline algorithm implementation and API

- Benchmark its performance, analyse the results, create hypothesis about where improvements could be found using theory from functioncal programming, stack/heap etc, profile the memory usages/allocations etc

- Research and document optimizations, create new iteration that implement optimizations, benchmark it again and compare performance to prior iterations in a systematic fashion

Inspiration: [The Fastest .NET Dictionary](https://youtu.be/le_1yMroz80?si=hdavMNVBmI8q2OwW). Repo [here](https://github.com/matthewcrews/FastDictionaryTest)

## Something about using [DMI's REST API](https://opendatadocs.dmi.govcloud.dk/en/Basics) to fetch metrological data

- Use DMI's api to get data
- Build some kind of app with the data

## Functional programming for web development:

Compare functional languages for web development
Pros/cons of using functional languages for web instead of javascript etc.
Build a web app in a functional language. 

## Using functional and imperative programming:

Could be a comparison of the two.
Could also look into how functional programming integrates into imperative programming (or object oriented programming).
Build some kind of project integrating the two paradigms. 

## Use Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) for real-time data visualization:

(I haven't read much about this topic, but skatten gives an explanation that sounds quite interesting):
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for working with reactive systems in a declarative way. 
It combines the principles of functional programming with reactive programming, allowing developers to model dynamic systems that change over time. 
FRP is particularly useful for applications that require continuous updates and real-time responsiveness, such as user interfaces, animations, and interactive simulations.
